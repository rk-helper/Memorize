// Struct in swift not only have variables, but functions and behaviours
// It will behaviour like a View
// This if functional programming
// We will talk about the concepts behind this behaviour using slides
// A view is just a rectangular area on the screen


struct ContentView: View {
    // This have is a neccessary if you have a View
    // var is the short for variable
    // Property means a var inside a struct or class
    // Syntaxis for property is the name
    // after : is the type of the property
    // Here this type is "some View"
    // Normally type looks like "var number: Int"
    // some View is any type and any struct as long it behaves like a view.
    // Views are like legos. You put all things together to make the lego universe.
    // There are special types of view to combine legoes.
    // combiner view can have tons and tons of views
    // This var is not stored in the memory, instead it is computed.
